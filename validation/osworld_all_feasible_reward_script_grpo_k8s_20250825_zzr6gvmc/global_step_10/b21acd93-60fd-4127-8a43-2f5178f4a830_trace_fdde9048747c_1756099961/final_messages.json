The introduction, which spans from \"Seeing\" to \"brains,\" uses single spacing; the main body continues until \"images including functional MRI,\" employing double spacing; and finally, I concluded with paragraphs on image manipulation and perception. Each section is formatted according to specifications - 12-point font, just right for showcasing professional writing skills.\n\nNow that the document is fully set up, every part meets the requirements perfectly: single spacing for clarity in the introduction, double spacing to emphasize key points in the body, and 1.5 line spacing for a thoughtful conclusion. This way, both aesthetics and readability are ensured.\n\n| Paragraph Type | Line Spacing | Font Size |\n|----------------|--------------|-----------|\n| Introduction   | Single       | 12 pt     |\n| Body           | Double       | 12 pt     |\n| Conclusion     | 1.5          | 12 pt     |\n\nWith this setup complete, my essay is ready for submission!"
