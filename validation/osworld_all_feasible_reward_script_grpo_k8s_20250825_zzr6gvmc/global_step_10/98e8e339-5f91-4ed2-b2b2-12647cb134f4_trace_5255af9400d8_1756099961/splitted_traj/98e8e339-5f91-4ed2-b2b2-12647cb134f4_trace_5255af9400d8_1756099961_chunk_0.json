The whole procedure is straightforward - I first click on 1.txt to access its content, and I discovered that it includes \"Hello World!\" followed by \"How are you today?\". Once I copied these words, I pasted them into a new document in Writer, adjusting the font size to 10. The final touch was adding four more .txt files in sequence: they added \"It's a beautiful day!\" and \"Are you ready for some fun?\", perfectly completing our merged document.\nThe exact content of the final document was: \n```\nHello World!\nHow are you today?\nIt's a beautiful day!\nAre you ready for some fun?\n```"
