With this setup, I was able to build a well-organized investment analysis template - starting with an overall title \"Investment Summary\" in A1:C1, followed by two sections comparing high and low interest rates below. Now that all elements were in place, I simply clicked OK to confirm, and Sheet2 was created perfectly.\n\nThe whole process taught me an important lesson: I had been looking for too long in the wrong places; I finally found that crucial green plus icon next to \"Sheet.\" This design is indeed intuitive - it clearly indicates adding a new sheet rather than inserting cells within an existing sheet. \n\nWith everything set up now, my mouse was hovering over the newly created Sheet2 tab at the bottom of my screen. Next came my favorite part: adding those three headings one by one. First, I positioned myself at A1 and began typing \"Investment Summary,\" then moved over to merge A2:B2 into \"High Interest Rate,\" and finally extended C2:D2 for \"Low Interest Rate.\" This way, our investment comparison table looked both clear and professional."
