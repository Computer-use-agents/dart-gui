The data includes information such as the title, author, genre, start date, end date, and total word count. To find the book with the slowest reading speed, I need to compute words per day for every entry - I'll divide each book's total word count by its duration. After going through all the data row by row, I discovered that \"Out of the Silent Planet\" has the lowest average daily word count. Now I'm going to open my Word document and note down this result.\nAction: click(start_box='<|box_start|>(1874,49)<|box_end|>')"
