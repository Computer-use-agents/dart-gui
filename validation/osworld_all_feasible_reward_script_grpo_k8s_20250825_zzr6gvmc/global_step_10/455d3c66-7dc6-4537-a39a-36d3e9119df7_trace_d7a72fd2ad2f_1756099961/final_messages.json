Once imported into PNG format, I saved it as res.png on my desktop. Now that all requirements have been met perfectly.\n\nI'm pleased with what we've accomplished; not only did we successfully convert from Impress format but also adjusted all parameters appropriately—from choosing an appropriate compression ratio for better quality images while keeping file size reasonable—downloading smoothly onto my desktop.\nWith everything set up properly now—I've confirmed both visually and via filename—that our task has been flawlessly wrapped up.\n\nclick(start_box='(146，79)')  \n\ndef convert_to_png():\n    # Accessing Export option\n    xExport = xModel.getExportHelper()\n    # Setting output format"
