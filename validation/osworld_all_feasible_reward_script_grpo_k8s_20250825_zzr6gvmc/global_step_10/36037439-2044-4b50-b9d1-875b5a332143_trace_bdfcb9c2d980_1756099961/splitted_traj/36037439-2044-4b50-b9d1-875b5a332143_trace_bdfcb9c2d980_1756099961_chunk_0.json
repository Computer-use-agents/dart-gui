The key steps were: 1) exiting full-screen mode; 2) finding and clicking \"scholar.google.com\"; 3) locating the authors' names in Figure 3; and finally, opening their profiles through Google Scholar.\n\nNow that all relevant information is displayed on my screen - both authors' names are clearly visible along with links to their published papers.\nAction: finished(content='I found that for this paper “World of Bits: An Open-Domain Platform for Web-Based Agents,” its corresponding authors are Frederica Dardari and Martina Mattavelli.')"
