By exporting it using \"Export As...\", I set the format to RTF and saved it as 'image.docx'. Now, looking back at my desktop, I could see a brand new document waiting for me.\n\nIn summary, we successfully completed three main steps: opening GIMP, selecting the right image from .xcf, and exporting it correctly.
