Specifically, I located this term within a programming assignment question about data structures, and by clicking on it and changing the font size, users can clearly see that it's different from regular text.\n\nThe entire adjustment process went smoothly: first, I pinpointed all instances of italicized text, then I used the font size dropdown menu to change them all to 14 points.

I increased their size to 14 points, and now they stand out clearly: one appears in bold italics within a question about inserting numbers into an AVL tree, while the other is part of a discussion on balanced factors. With this adjustment, users can easily recognize italicized text; all I needed to do was click on these two locations and change their font size from 12 to 14.\n\nNow that every italicized piece of text has been properly formatted, this accessibility enhancement task can be considered successfully completed.\nAction: click(start_box='<|box_start|>(685,149)<|box_end|>')"
