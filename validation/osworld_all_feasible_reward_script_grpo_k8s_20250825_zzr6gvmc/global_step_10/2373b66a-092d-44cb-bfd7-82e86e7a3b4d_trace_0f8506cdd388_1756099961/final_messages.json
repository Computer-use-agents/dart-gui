I discovered that I had finally located the right tool - the terminal icon shaped like a lightbulb, which is the seventh one from the bottom on my desktop.Now I completely understand how to monitor system resources: I need to use the sar command with parameters `-n ALL -r -u -d 1 30`. Let me break it down: `-n ALL` captures all types of system statistics, `-r` includes network data, `-u` shows CPU usage, and by setting a sampling interval of 1 second over 30 seconds, I can generate detailed resource reports. Once these data are collected, I'll save them into a file on my desktop.\nThe terminal icon is now clearly visible to me—it's that blue lightbulb button. Clicking on it opens an interactive command line interface where I can start our monitoring task.\nThe correct terminal icon is actually in the third position from the bottom on my left sidebar; its design features a white lightbulb symbol. By entering \"sar -n ALL -r -u -d 1 30 > System_Resources_Report.txt,\" I can simultaneously collect comprehensive system performance metrics and export them directly to my desktop file.\nI'm ready to click this icon and begin our journey into analyzing system resources."
